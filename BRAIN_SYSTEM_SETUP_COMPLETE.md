## 🚀 How to Use the Brain

### **For Development Agents:**

**Start of new session:**
```markdown
1. Read: C:\Users\Tucke\Documents\augment-projects\Optimize Projects\TRE_BRAIN\NEW_AGENT_PROMPT.md
2. Check "Just Completed" - what's new
3. Check "Active Work" - current status
4. Check "Critical Gotchas" - avoid breaking things
5. Start coding with full context!
```

### **For Brain Agent:**

**When you say "update brain":**
```markdown
1. Brain Agent checks git history (READ-ONLY)
2. Analyzes commits (🔴 Critical, 🟡 Major, 🟢 Minor)
3. Updates brain files in TRE_BRAIN folder
4. Shows you a summary
```

---

## 🔄 Update Process

### **When to Update:**
- ✅ Every 2-3 days (keep brain fresh)
- ✅ After major features completed
- ✅ Before spawning new development agent
- ✅ When you say "update brain"

### **How to Spawn Brain Agent:**

1. **Open new Augment chat** (separate window)
2. **Copy-paste this file:**
   ```
   C:\Users\Tucke\Documents\augment-projects\Optimize Projects\TRE_BRAIN\BRAIN_AGENT_SESSION_PROMPT.md
   ```
3. **Brain Agent confirms understanding**
4. **Say "update brain" when ready**

## 🎯 Brain Value Proposition

### **Temporal Context (What Codebase Retrieval Can't Tell You):**

✅ What's happening **RIGHT NOW** in the project  
✅ What's been tried and **failed** (save time)  
✅ Recent decisions and **why** they were made  
✅ User preferences and conventions discovered  
✅ Critical gotchas that will **break things**  

### **Example:**
- **Codebase Retrieval:** "Here's the Smart Match algorithm code"
- **Brain:** "We tried 5 different matching approaches. The current one uses configurable bedroom/bathroom matching because hardcoded exact matching didn't work for all markets. Don't change it back to exact matching - we already tried that."
