## 🎯 What This Checkpoint Captures

This checkpoint represents a **major milestone** in the TRE CRM application with complete Phase 1 activity event tracking implemented.

### **Major Features:**

1. ✅ **Agent Assignment Tracking**
   - Logs when agents are assigned/unassigned to leads
   - Tracks who made the change and when
   - Shows previous and new agent information

2. ✅ **Health Status Change Tracking**
   - Logs all health status transitions (green → yellow → red → closed)
   - Tracks health scores and reasons for changes
   - Distinguishes between manual and auto-calculated changes

3. ✅ **Lead Preferences Tracking**
   - Logs when lead preferences are updated
   - Shows field-by-field changes with old → new values
   - Tracks budget, bedroom, bathroom, and other preference changes

4. ✅ **Property Update Tracking**
   - Logs all property information changes
   - Tracks rent changes, name changes, address updates, etc.
   - Shows detailed before/after values

5. ✅ **Availability & PUMI Status Tracking**
   - Logs when properties are marked available/unavailable
   - Tracks PUMI status changes
   - Shows who made the change and reason

6. ✅ **INACTIVITY DETECTION SYSTEM** (Critical Feature!)
   - Automated system to detect inactive leads
   - 36 hours no activity → Yellow health status
   - 72 hours no activity → Red health status
   - Inactivity events don't count as activity (prevents false positives)
   - Manual trigger available: `window.runInactivityDetection()`
   - Ready for scheduled deployment (hourly cron job)

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Inactivity Detection:** Currently requires manual trigger. Set up cron job for production.
2. **User Context:** All activities now track who performed the action.
3. **Metadata:** All activities include detailed metadata for audit trail.
4. **Performance:** Activity logging is non-blocking - updates succeed even if logging fails.
