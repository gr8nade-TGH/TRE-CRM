# Checkpoint: Properties & Specials Page - Fully Working

**Date:** October 24, 2025, 8:52 PM  
**Branch:** `feature/page-functions`  
**Commit:** `6a4171a`  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL FEATURES WORKING**

---

## 🎯 What's Working

### ✅ Properties & Specials Page - Complete Functionality

1. **📞 Phone Icon (Edit Contact Info)**
   - Opens "Update Property Contact Info" modal
   - Property dropdown auto-populated and pre-selected
   - **NEW:** Address field added - syncs with Listings page
   - Contact Name, Email, Phone fields
   - Office Hours field
   - Notes field
   - Save button works perfectly
   - Activity logging works (no more `community_name` column errors)
   - Refreshes table after save

2. **🔥 Fire Icon (Add/Edit Special)**
   - Shows "Add Special" for properties without active specials
   - Shows "Edit Special" for properties with active specials
   - Opens appropriate modal
   - **FIXED:** RLS policy allows all authenticated users to add/edit/delete specials
   - No more "row violates row-level security policy" errors
   - Saves specials successfully
   - Updates fire icon state after save

3. **Address Synchronization - MAJOR FIX**
   - ✅ Edit address on Properties page → syncs to Listings page
   - ✅ Edit address on Listings page → syncs to Properties page
   - ✅ Single source of truth for property addresses
   - Properties page uses single "Address" field
   - Listings page uses separate Street/City/State/Zip fields
   - Both update combined `address` AND separate `street_address/city/state/zip_code` fields

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified

1. **index.html**
   - Added address field to Contact Info modal (line ~1363)
   - Field includes placeholder and hint text

2. **src/modules/properties/properties-rendering.js**
   - `editPropertyContact`: Populates address field from property data
   - `savePropertyContact`: Reads and saves address field
   - Passes address to `updatePropertyContact` API

3. **src/api/supabase-api.js**
   - `updatePropertyContact`: Enhanced to handle address sync
     - Accepts `address` parameter
     - Parses combined address into separate fields (street/city/state/zip)
     - Updates both combined and separate address fields
     - Logs address updates in activity metadata
   - Fixed `logPropertyActivity`: Removed `community_name` column (moved to metadata)

4. **src/modules/modals/listing-modals.js**
   - `saveListingEdit`: Builds combined address from separate fields
   - Updates both `address` and `street_address/city/state/zip_code`
   - Ensures sync with Properties page

### Database Changes

**Migration:** `migrations/031_fix_specials_rls.sql` (Successfully applied)

```sql
-- Allows all authenticated users to insert/update/delete specials
