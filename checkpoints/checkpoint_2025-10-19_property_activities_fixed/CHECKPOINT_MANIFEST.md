## 🔧 Technical Details

### **RLS Policies**
All property-related tables now have simple, permissive RLS policies:
- `property_activities`: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for authenticated users
- `property_notes`: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for authenticated users

### **Foreign Key Constraints**
Removed constraints to allow email-based user identification:
- `property_activities.performed_by` - No longer requires UUID from `users.id`
- `property_notes.author_id` - No longer requires UUID from `users.id`

### **Activity Logging Pattern**
```javascript
// In createProperty function
await createPropertyActivity({
    property_id: data.id,
    activity_type: 'property_created',
    description: 'Property added to inventory',
    metadata: {
        method: 'manual',
        initial_data: { /* property snapshot */ }
    },
    performed_by: propertyData.created_by,
    performed_by_name: null
});
```

## 📊 Console Output (Expected)

When creating a new listing, you should see:
```
✅ Property created: {id: "...", name: "...", ...}
🔵 createPropertyActivity called with: {property_id: "...", activity_type: "property_created", ...}
✅ createPropertyActivity returning: {id: "...", property_id: "...", ...}
✅ Property note created
🔵 createPropertyActivity called with: {property_id: "...", activity_type: "note_added", ...}
✅ createPropertyActivity returning: {id: "...", property_id: "...", ...}
```

When viewing activity log:
```
🔵 getPropertyActivities called for property: ...
✅ getPropertyActivities returning: Array(2)
  0: {activity_type: "property_created", description: "Property added to inventory", ...}
  1: {activity_type: "note_added", description: "Added property note", ...}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Suggestions)

- [ ] Add more activity types (e.g., "pricing_updated", "pumi_changed")
- [ ] Add activity filtering/search in the modal
- [ ] Add activity export functionality
- [ ] Add real-time activity updates using Supabase Realtime
- [ ] Add activity notifications for important events
