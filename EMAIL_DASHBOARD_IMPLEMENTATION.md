# Email Dashboard Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

**Commit:** `25ad967` - feat: Add comprehensive email dashboard with role-based filtering

---

## 📋 **What Was Built**

### **1. Email Rendering Module** (`src/modules/emails/emails-rendering.js`)

**Main Functions:**
- `renderEmails()` - Main dashboard render function (renders all sections in parallel)
- `renderEmailStatistics()` - Statistics cards showing:
  - Emails sent today
  - Emails sent this week
  - Emails sent this month
  - Success rate (sent vs failed)
  - Failed email count
  - Most used template
- `renderEmailLogs()` - Email logs table with:
  - Recipient name and email
  - Subject line
  - Template used
  - Status badge (pending, sent, delivered, failed, bounced)
  - Sent date/time
  - Sent by (user name)
  - View details button
  - Pagination (20 emails per page)
  - Search and filter support
- `renderEmailTemplates()` - Template cards showing:
  - Template name and description
  - Category badge (lead, agent, document, system)
  - Active/inactive status
  - Subject line
  - Variables list
  - Preview button
- `previousEmailsPage()` / `nextEmailsPage()` - Pagination navigation
- `resetEmailsPagination()` - Reset to page 1

**Role-Based Filtering:**
- **Managers & Super Users**: See ALL emails sent by entire team
- **Agents**: Only see emails that are:
  - Sent to their assigned leads (checked via metadata.agent_id)
  - Sent by them (sent_by matches their user ID)
  - Agent assignment emails sent to them (template_id = 'agent_assignment' and recipient_email matches)

**Functions:**
- `showEmailDetails(emailId, options)` - Shows detailed modal with:
  - Recipient information

  - Timeline (created → sent → delivered)
  - Metadata (lead_id, agent_id, email_type, etc.)
  - Error message (if failed)
  - Resend ID
  - Sent by user
- `showTemplatePreview(templateId, options)` - Shows template preview modal with:
  - Template name and description
  - Subject, category, status
  - Variables list

  - HTML source code (collapsible)
- `filterEmailsByStatus()` - Filter emails by status

---
