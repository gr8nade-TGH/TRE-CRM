# Smart Match Privacy Verification

## Overview
This document verifies that commission percentage (`commission_pct`) and PUMI status (`is_pumi`) are NEVER exposed to leads in the Smart Match feature.

## Privacy Requirements
✅ Commission and PUMI data are used ONLY for internal scoring/ranking  
✅ Commission and PUMI data are NEVER shown to leads in any UI  
✅ Commission and PUMI data are NEVER included in API responses accessible to leads  

---

## Implementation Verification

### 1. ✅ Database Layer (Supabase API)
**File:** `src/api/supabase-api.js` (Lines 2120-2138)

**Privacy Protection:**
```javascript
// Step 5: Transform results to include all necessary data for display
// Remove commission_pct and is_pumi from property data (privacy)
const sanitizedMatches = matches.map(match => {
    const { commission_pct, is_pumi, ...sanitizedProperty } = match.property;
    
    return {
        unit: match.unit,
        floorPlan: match.floorPlan,
        property: sanitizedProperty, // ✅ commission_pct and is_pumi removed
        matchScore: {
            // Include score breakdown but NOT commission/pumi details
            bedrooms: match.matchScore.bedrooms,
            bathrooms: match.matchScore.bathrooms,
            price: match.matchScore.price,
            location: match.matchScore.location,
            moveInDate: match.matchScore.moveInDate,
            baseScore: match.matchScore.baseScore,
            totalScore: match.matchScore.totalScore
            // ✅ Intentionally exclude: commission, pumi, bonusScore
        }
    };
});
```

**Result:** ✅ `commission_pct` and `is_pumi` are stripped from the property object before returning to the API wrapper.

---

### 2. ✅ API Wrapper Layer
**File:** `src/api/api-wrapper.js` (Lines 51-100)

**Privacy Protection:**
```javascript
return {
    id: unit.id,
    name: property.name || property.community_name || 'Property',
    rent_min: rent,
    rent_max: rent,
    beds_min: floorPlan.beds,
    beds_max: floorPlan.beds,
    baths_min: floorPlan.baths,
    baths_max: floorPlan.baths,
    sqft_min: floorPlan.sqft || 0,
    sqft_max: floorPlan.sqft || 0,
    effective_commission_pct: 0, // ✅ Hidden for privacy (not shown to leads)
    specials_text: specialsText,
    bonus_text: bonusText,
    image_url: imageUrl,
    // Include match score for internal use (not displayed to leads)
    _matchScore: matchScore.totalScore,
    _unit_number: unit.unit_number,
    _floor_plan_name: floorPlan.name
};
```

**Result:** ✅ `effective_commission_pct` is set to 0 (not shown to leads). The `property` object no longer contains `commission_pct` or `is_pumi` fields.

---

### 3. ✅ UI Layer (Showcase Modal)
**File:** `src/modules/modals/showcase-modals.js` (Lines 18-32)

**Privacy Protection:**
```javascript
// Build commission badge (only show if > 0, for internal agent use only)
const commissionBadge = item.effective_commission_pct > 0 
    ? `<div class="listing-badge">${item.effective_commission_pct}% Commission</div>`
    : '';

card.innerHTML = `
    <div class="listing-image">
        <img src="${item.image_url}" alt="${item.name}" loading="lazy">
        ${commissionBadge}
    </div>
    ...
`;
```

**Result:** ✅ Commission badge is NOT displayed when `effective_commission_pct` is 0 (which it always is for Smart Match results).

---

### 4. ✅ Scoring Algorithm (Internal Only)
**File:** `src/utils/smart-match.js`

**Privacy Protection:**
- Commission and PUMI data are used ONLY within the `calculateMatchScore()` function
- These values are used to calculate `bonusScore` but are NOT returned in the final match results
- The scoring breakdown returned includes `baseScore` and `totalScore` but NOT `commission` or `pumi` individual scores

**Result:** ✅ Commission and PUMI are used for scoring but never exposed outside the scoring function.

## Privacy Verification Checklist

| Layer | Privacy Check | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Database Query | Fetches commission_pct and is_pumi from database | ✅ Required for scoring |
| Scoring Algorithm | Uses commission_pct and is_pumi for scoring | ✅ Internal use only |
| Supabase API Response | Strips commission_pct and is_pumi from property object | ✅ Sanitized |
| Supabase API Response | Excludes commission/pumi scores from matchScore | ✅ Sanitized |
| API Wrapper | Sets effective_commission_pct to 0 | ✅ Hidden |
| API Wrapper | Does not include commission_pct or is_pumi | ✅ Not present |
| UI (Showcase Modal) | Does not display commission badge when 0 | ✅ Hidden |
| UI (Email Templates) | Does not include commission or PUMI data | ✅ Not accessible |

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Lead Views Smart Match Results
**Expected Behavior:**
- Lead sees property name, rent, beds, baths, sqft, specials, amenities
- Lead does NOT see commission percentage
- Lead does NOT see PUMI status
- Lead does NOT see match score breakdown showing commission/PUMI bonuses

**Verification:** ✅ PASS

### Scenario 2: Agent Views Smart Match Results (Internal Dashboard)
**Expected Behavior:**
- Agent sees all property details
- Agent can see match scores for debugging (via `_matchScore` field)
- Agent does NOT see commission in the showcase modal (privacy maintained)
- Agent CAN see commission in the Listings page (separate feature)

**Verification:** ✅ PASS

### Scenario 3: API Response Inspection
**Expected Behavior:**
- API response from `getSmartMatches()` does NOT contain `commission_pct` field
- API response from `getSmartMatches()` does NOT contain `is_pumi` field
- API response from `getMatches()` (wrapper) sets `effective_commission_pct: 0`

**Verification:** ✅ PASS

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Privacy Verified:** Commission percentage and PUMI status are NEVER exposed to leads.

**Data Flow:**
1. Database → Scoring Algorithm (commission & PUMI used for ranking)
2. Scoring Algorithm → Supabase API (commission & PUMI stripped from response)
3. Supabase API → API Wrapper (commission set to 0)
4. API Wrapper → UI (commission badge hidden when 0)

**Result:** Leads see intelligently matched properties without knowing the business logic behind the ranking.
