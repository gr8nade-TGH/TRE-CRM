## 🔍 Deep Dive: What is Apartment List?

### **Apartment List Business Model:**

**For Property Managers:**
- List your properties on ApartmentList.com
- Renters search and apply
- You pay **per lease** (not per listing)
- Performance-based pricing
- Free to list, only pay when you get a tenant

**For Renters:**
- Search for apartments
- View listings
- Apply online
- Free to use

**Data Flow:**
```
Property Manager → Uploads listings to Apartment List
                ↓
           Apartment List Platform
                ↓
           Renters search and apply
                ↓
           Property Manager pays per lease
```

### **Apartment List "Data Feed":**

When property managers talk about "Apartment List data feed," they mean:
- **Outbound feed:** Sending YOUR property data TO Apartment List
- **Not an API:** No way to GET data FROM Apartment List
- **Integration methods:**
  - Manual entry via Partner Portal
  - Property management software integration (Yardi, RealPage, AppFolio)
  - Syndication services (RentLinx, Zumper)

**What You CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ Pull data about OTHER properties from Apartment List
- ❌ Get rental listings for San Antonio apartments
- ❌ Access their database via API
- ❌ Use their data for your CRM

**What You CAN Do:**
- ✅ List YOUR properties on Apartment List
