# Email Dashboard Improvements

**Commit:** `1b8e527` - fix: Fix email template preview button and add agent filter to email dashboard

---

## 🐛 **Issue 1: Fixed Template Preview Button Bug**

### **Problem**
The template preview button was throwing a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'showTemplatePreview')` at line 1709 in `dom-event-listeners.js`.

The issue was that the event listener was using dynamic imports inside a delegated event handler, but the module wasn't being properly resolved before calling the function.

### **Solution**

1. **Created `showTemplatePreview()` function in `script.js`:**
   ```javascript
   async function showTemplatePreview(templateId) {
       await Emails.showTemplatePreview(templateId, { api, showModal });
   }
   ```

2. **Added function to dependencies:**
   - Added `showTemplatePreview` to `createDependencies()` call in `script.js`
   - Added to destructured deps in `setupAllEventListeners()` in `dom-event-listeners.js`

3. **Updated event listener to use the function from deps:**
   ```javascript
   // Preview email template
   if (e.target.closest('.preview-template')) {
       const templateId = e.target.closest('.preview-template').dataset.templateId;
       await showTemplatePreview(templateId);
       e.preventDefault();
       return;
   }
   ```

### **Files Modified**
- `script.js` - Added `showTemplatePreview()` function and added to deps
- `src/events/dom-event-listeners.js` - Updated event listener to use function from deps

## ✨ **Issue 2: Added Agent Filter to Email Dashboard**

### **Requirements Implemented**

✅ **1. Agent Filter Dropdown**
- Added new dropdown in email logs section (next to status filter)
- Label: "Sent By"
- Options:
  - "All Agents" (default) - shows all emails
  - "System (Automated)" - shows only emails where `sent_by` is null
  - Individual agent names - one option for each agent

✅ **2. Combined Filtering**
- Agent filter works in combination with:
  - Status filter (pending, sent, delivered, failed, bounced)
  - Search filter (by recipient/subject)
  - All filters reset pagination to page 1

✅ **3. Agent Breakdown Statistics**
- Added new statistics card for managers/super users
- Shows "Emails by Agent" with:
  - System email count (if any)
  - Top 5 agents by email count
  - Visual count badges for each agent
- Card spans 2 columns in the grid for better visibility

✅ **4. Role-Based Access Control**
- **Agents:** Only see their own name in the dropdown
- **Managers/Super Users:** See all agents in the dropdown
- Agent breakdown statistics only visible to managers/super users

---

## 📋 **Implementation Details**

### **1. HTML Changes** (`index.html`)

Added agent filter dropdown to email logs section:
```html
<select id="emailAgentFilter">
    <option value="">All Agents</option>
    <!-- Options populated dynamically -->
</select>
```

### **2. Rendering Module Changes** (`src/modules/emails/emails-rendering.js`)

#### **A. Added `populateAgentFilter()` function:**
- Fetches all users from database
- Filters to only agents, managers, and super users
- Sorts by name
- For agents: only shows their own name
- For managers/super users: shows all agents
- Adds "System (Automated)" option for system emails

#### **B. Updated `renderEmails()` function:**
- Calls `populateAgentFilter()` before rendering sections
- Ensures dropdown is populated when page loads

#### **C. Updated `renderEmailLogs()` function:**
- Gets agent filter value from dropdown
- Filters emails by agent:
  - If "system" selected: shows only emails where `sent_by` is null
  - If agent ID selected: shows only emails sent by that agent
  - If empty: shows all emails (respecting role-based filtering)
- Agent filter applied after role-based filtering but before search filtering

#### **D. Updated `renderEmailStatistics()` function:**
- Added agent breakdown statistics for managers/super users
- Fetches users to map user IDs to names
- Counts emails by agent
- Counts system emails (sent_by is null)
- Sorts agents by email count (descending)
- Shows top 5 agents
- Renders agent breakdown card with list of agents and counts

### **3. Event Listener Changes** (`src/events/dom-event-listeners.js`)

Added event listener for agent filter:
```javascript
if (emailAgentFilter) {
    emailAgentFilter.addEventListener('change', async () => {
        const { Emails } = await import('../modules/emails/index.js');
        Emails.resetEmailsPagination();
        await Emails.renderEmailLogs({ api, state, showEmailPreview });
    });
}
```

### **4. CSS Changes** (`styles.css`)

Added styles for agent breakdown card:
```css
/* Agent Breakdown Card */
.stat-card.agent-breakdown {
    grid-column: span 2;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
}

.agent-stats-list {
    margin-top: 10px;
    width: 100%;
}

.agent-stat-item {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 8px 0;
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--rule);
    font-size: 14px;
}

.agent-count {
    background: var(--primary);
    color: white;
    padding: 2px 8px;
    border-radius: 12px;
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

## 🔄 **Filter Behavior**

### **Example 1: Filter by Agent**
1. User selects "John Smith" from agent filter
2. Pagination resets to page 1
3. Email logs table shows only emails sent by John Smith
4. Search and status filters still work on this filtered set

### **Example 2: Filter by System**
1. User selects "System (Automated)" from agent filter
2. Pagination resets to page 1
3. Email logs table shows only automated emails (sent_by is null)
4. Useful for seeing welcome emails, automated notifications, etc.

### **Example 3: Combined Filters**
1. User selects "Jane Doe" from agent filter
2. User selects "Failed" from status filter
3. User types "john@example.com" in search
4. Result: Shows only failed emails sent by Jane Doe to recipients matching "john@example.com"
