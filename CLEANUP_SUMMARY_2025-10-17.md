## 🔍 Verification

### Verified Empty Before Removal:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "scripts" -Recurse | Measure-Object → Count: 0
Get-ChildItem -Path "docs" -Recurse | Measure-Object → Count: 0
Get-ChildItem -Path "prisma" -Recurse | Measure-Object → Count: 0
Get-ChildItem -Path "tre-crm-backend" -Recurse | Measure-Object → Count: 0
Get-ChildItem -Path "src/features" -Recurse | Measure-Object → Count: 0
Get-ChildItem -Path "src/routing" -Recurse | Measure-Object → Count: 0
```

### Verified Removal:
```powershell
src/ now contains only: api/, state/, utils/, README.md
```

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If you ever need to restore the empty folders (unlikely):

```powershell
# Create empty folders
New-Item -Path "scripts" -ItemType Directory
New-Item -Path "docs" -ItemType Directory
New-Item -Path "prisma" -ItemType Directory
New-Item -Path "tre-crm-backend" -ItemType Directory
New-Item -Path "src/features" -ItemType Directory
New-Item -Path "src/routing" -ItemType Directory
```

But since they were empty, there's no reason to restore them.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

**Recommended:**
- Continue using the current modular structure
- Add new features as needed
- Keep documentation updated

**Optional Future Work:**
- Extract feature modules (leads, agents, properties) if desired
- Create routing module if needed
- Add more utility functions as needed

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Cleanup completed successfully with **zero risk** and **zero impact** on functionality.

The project structure is now cleaner and easier to navigate, with only active folders remaining.

**Everything is still working perfectly!** ✅
